This repository contains a final project delivered in one of the subjects of the software engineering degree at the University of Mendoza. 
The objective was to be able to create a server and a client in C, using low-level tools such as Sockets, Threads, Processes, Communication between processes, among others. 
The software consists of a chat for customer service, where customers connect to the server and match when there are customer service employees connected. 
It was a project that gave me great knowledge and personal growth, without a doubt I learned a lot.
